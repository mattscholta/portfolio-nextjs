        I am actually pleasantly surprised how small this list is... These
        programs are at the <b>core</b> of everything I do daily. While we can
        write code in in VIM or a text editor, life is just better with the
        right tools.

        Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four
        sharpening the ax.

        Is my editor of choice and <b>I could not be happier!</b> It 100% does
        everything I need it to and I am continuously impressed by the
        improvements I've seen to date.

      <p>
        As far as terminal users go, I use it heavily every day. iTerm2 is free
        and full of features I use and many that I don't even know exist. Tabs,
        split-view, fast and reliable.

      <p>
        At the core of the modern development workflow is 🐳 Docker. I can't
        begin to explain how enjoyable a great docker and docker-compose
        workflow can be.

        It's not that often that get to play designer but I do enjoy keeping up
        with the tools. Figma is available in the browser + app and fast, love
        it!
